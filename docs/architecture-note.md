# Pipeline Architecture Note

*Updated after L3 (system architecture & component design) — June 2026.*
*Supersedes the post-L1 draft. The L1 findings are retained in §2 as problem motivation; the working dataset and integration target have moved to the Docker pipeline (see §1, §3).*

---

## 1. Pipeline lineage — what this thesis builds on

The FAIR Jupyter reproducibility pipeline has three generations. This thesis adds the third.

| Generation | What it does | Role for this thesis |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Conda pipeline** (Samuel & Mietchen, GigaScience 2024, ref [2]) | 16-step pipeline; a fresh conda env per repo; runs every notebook and logs failures. Produced the full published study. | Source of the problem-scale numbers (§2). Not the integration target. |
| **2. Docker pipeline** (Samuel et al. 2025, ref [1]; repo `Sheeba-Samuel/computational-reproducibility-pmc-docker`) | Containerizes each repo before execution, recovering many environment failures. Richer result schema (`notebook_executions`, with pre-categorized errors). | **The integration target — this thesis builds here.** |
| **3. LLM repair layer** (this thesis) | Explains and fixes the dependency failures the Docker pipeline still only *logs*. | The contribution. |

**Decision (L3):** build on the Docker pipeline. Its residual dependency failures — notebooks that fail even after containerization — are exactly the gap this thesis targets, and its schema already pre-classifies errors (see §3–§4).

---

## 2. Scale of the problem (L1 findings — motivation only)

From the full original **conda** study (every notebook executed):

- Total notebooks executed: **10,389**
- `ModuleNotFoundError`: 5,562 (53.5%)
- `ImportError`: 1,014 (9.8%)
- Combined dependency-failure target: **6,576 (63.3%)**

Top missing modules (parsed from `executions.msg`): anndata (1258), scanpy (423), pandas (177), cemba_data (176), tensorflow (149), Bio (108), fastai (103)… — dominantly biomedical, consistent with the PubMed Central origin.

**These numbers motivate the problem; they are not the working dataset.** They come from the full conda run. The dataset this thesis operates on is the Docker pipeline's dependency-error set (§3), currently a partial sample (214 targets). No fuller Docker run is available, so 214 (≈204 pip-fixable) is the working set; the 6,576 stands as evidence of scale.

---

## 3. Integration point

- **Hook-in:** immediately after the Docker pipeline writes a row into the `notebook_executions` table tagged `error_category = 'DEPENDENCY_ERROR'` (written in `scripts/nbprocess/summary.py`).
- **`DEPENDENCY_ERROR` = `ModuleNotFoundError` + `ImportError`, exactly** — the pipeline's `categorize_error_type()` maps only these two into that bucket. In the current sample: 172 + 42 = 214 rows.
- **All 214 rows reach `LLMExplainer` (O1).** The ErrorClassifier does not drop any `DEPENDENCY_ERROR` row from explanation — it only tags each row's `subtype` and a repair-eligibility flag (`scope_status`). *(i4 refinement — see §7.)*
- **Repair-fixable subset ≈ 200 of 214.** ~10 rows are missing *system* libraries (`.so` files) needing `apt`, not `pip`; a further ~4 are ambiguous local-module names (`utils`, `statistics`, …). These 14 rows are marked `scope_status = "excluded"` and are the ones that skip `RAGRepairAgent`/`FixApplicator` — they still get an explanation. The exact count (200 usable / 14 excluded, confirmed by the i1 implementation in `scripts/prepare_dependency_dataset.py`) supersedes this section's earlier "≈204" estimate, which predates i1.
- **Execution model:** a batch pass over the `DEPENDENCY_ERROR` rows (results already exist — no re-running of pipeline phases). Fixes are applied and validated **inside each repository's Docker container**, re-running the notebook top-to-bottom (a partial re-run cannot validate a fix).
- **Matching-environment principle:** failures and re-execution both happen in the Docker environment, so a success is attributable to the fix and not to a different setup.

---

## 4. Data available at the hook-in point

Per failed notebook, from `notebook_executions`:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `error_type` | exception class (e.g. ModuleNotFoundError) — the "reason" |
| `error_message` | error text (short, e.g. "No module named 'scanpy'") |
| `error_category` | pre-set bucket; the trigger filter |
| `error_cell_index` | which cell failed |
| `notebook_id`, `repository_id` | links to notebook + repo |
| `notebook_name`, `url` | notebook name + GitHub URL |
| `total_code_cells`, `executed_cells` | progress before failure |

Also available: the cloned repo on disk (`requirements.txt`, the `.ipynb`), and — if the short `error_message` is insufficient — the full traceback in the legacy `executions.msg` column.

*Field-name change from the conda plan:* `reason → error_type`, `msg → error_message`, `cell → error_cell_index`.

---

## 5. System architecture — the repair layer

Five components, sequenced by an orchestrator as a **procedural pipeline** — a fixed sequence, not a self-directing agent (the design choice justified by Yang et al. [15] for batch scalability).

### Component contracts

| Component | Job | In | Out |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ErrorClassifier** | classify subtype + flag repair eligibility | the failed-notebook record | `subtype` (missing_package / wrong_version / system_library / mapping_unknown), `scope_status` (usable / excluded), `exclusion_reason`, `failing_module` |
| **LLMExplainer** (O1) | plain-language explanation | classified record (**every** subtype) + model/prompt config | `explanation_text`, `model_used` |
| **RAGRepairAgent** (O2) | propose a structured fix grounded in PyPI | classified record where `scope_status == "usable"` + requirements/imports + config; optionally a prior failed attempt | a fix object (§6.1) |
| **FixApplicator** (O3) | apply the fix, re-run, judge | fix object + the repo's container | `outcome` (fixed / still_failing / apply_error), new error if any |
| **ResultLogger** (O4+O6) | persist everything | the full accumulated record | a `repair_attempts` row (§6.2) + RDF triples (§6.3) |

*(i4 refinement — see §7. Earlier drafts of this note gated LLMExplainer behind the same "in scope" signal as RAGRepairAgent; ErrorClassifier no longer withholds a skip signal from explanation, only from repair.)*

### Orchestrator

- **Sequence:** for each row → ErrorClassifier → LLMExplainer (always) → (if `scope_status == "usable"`) RAGRepairAgent → FixApplicator → ResultLogger.
- **One-round vs two-round switch (ablation e3):** if `still_failing` and two-round mode is on, feed the new error back to RAGRepairAgent once more, re-apply, then log.
- **Failure handling:** every attempt is logged even when a component errors (malformed LLM output, PyPI unreachable, re-exec timeout); one bad notebook never crashes the batch.
- **Config surface (NFR5):** model, prompt strategy, and round count are injected, so they can be swapped without code changes.

**Implemented (i7):** `scripts/run_pipeline.py` implements exactly this sequence and switch -
`--max-rounds 1|2` for the one-round/two-round control, one shared orchestration-level `run_id`
threaded through every component call, and the same per-record failure isolation described above.
The bounded second round's exact trigger condition, the cumulative Round 1 + Round 2 environment
strategy, and the CLI/resume contract are documented in full in `docs/pipeline-orchestrator.md`
rather than repeated here. Small real-pilot validation (real Ollama/PyPI/Docker, `--split dev` only)
is recorded there and in the i7 completion report; the full 187-row evaluation run itself is still
future work (§13 of `docs/pipeline-orchestrator.md`).

---

## 6. Data contracts

### 6.1 Fix object — RAGRepairAgent output (pip-only v1)

JSON; the *proposed* fix, before application. `replace_import` (notebook code edits) is deferred to future work.

```json
{
  "action": "pin_version",
  "import_name": "scanpy",
  "install_name": "scanpy",
  "version": "1.9.3",
  "command": "pip install scanpy==1.9.3",
  "rationale": "Notebook needs an API present only up to 1.9.x; pinning the last compatible release.",
  "pypi_evidence": {
    "latest_version": "1.10.1",
    "chosen_version": "1.9.3",
    "requires_python": ">=3.9"
  }
}
```

`action` ∈ `install | pin_version | none`. `version` is `null` for a plain install. `command` is what the FixApplicator runs inside the container.

`command` is always constructed by deterministic code from the validated `install_name`/`version`, after those fields have been checked against retrieved PyPI/compatibility evidence - it is never taken from LLM output, even though the LLM proposes `action`/`install_name`/`version` themselves. See `docs/rag-design.md` §2.2 and `docs/prompts.md` §8 ("Command construction") for the full contract.

### 6.2 `repair_attempts` table — SQLite

The validation log *and* the benchmark dataset (O4). One row per attempt (a two-round repair = two rows; different models/prompts = more rows), linked to the existing `notebook_executions`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE repair_attempts (
  id                      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  notebook_execution_id   INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- FK -> notebook_executions.id (the failure being repaired)

  -- from ErrorClassifier
  failing_module          TEXT,               -- e.g. "scanpy"
  subtype                 TEXT,               -- missing_package | wrong_version

  -- from LLMExplainer (O1)
  explanation             TEXT,

  -- from RAGRepairAgent -- the proposed fix (O2)

  install_name            TEXT,               -- resolved PyPI name
  version                 TEXT,               -- version to pin, or NULL
  command                 TEXT,               -- exact command run
  rationale               TEXT,
  pypi_evidence           TEXT,               -- JSON: versions seen, requires_python

  -- from FixApplicator -- the outcome (O3)
  outcome                 TEXT,               -- fixed | still_failing | apply_error
  new_error_type          TEXT,
  new_error_message       TEXT,

  -- run metadata (for experiments)
  llm_model               TEXT,
  prompt_strategy         TEXT,               -- for the L4 prompt comparison
  round                   INTEGER,            -- 1 or 2 (the ablation)
  run_id                  TEXT,               -- groups one run / config
  created_at              TEXT,

  FOREIGN KEY (notebook_execution_id) REFERENCES notebook_executions(id)
);
```

### 6.3 KG enrichment — RML mapping → RDF (O6)

The FAIR Jupyter KG is generated from per-table RML mappings (`.rml.ttl`) run by `run_fairjupyter_kg.sh`. O6 = add one mapping, `repair_attempts.rml.ttl`, modeled on the existing `mapping/rml_mapping/executions.rml.ttl`. It re-expresses each repair row as triples and links them to the notebook node already in the graph — so the repair history is queryable alongside the existing reproducibility data.

Vocabulary (per L2 notes): *reuse* existing `repr:` terms where they fit (e.g. `repr:exception`), *add* new `repr:` terms for repair-specific facts, and use *PROV-O* for the activity/agent/time layer. Namespace `repr:` = `https://w3id.org/reproduceme/`; serialization Turtle (`.ttl`).

Example triples for one repair:

```turtle
repr:notebook_512  repr:hadRepairAttempt  repr:repairattempt_001 .

repr:repairattempt_001
    a                       prov:Activity, repr:RepairAttempt ;
    repr:exception          "ModuleNotFoundError" ;          # reused term
    repr:failingModule      "scanpy" ;                       # new term
    repr:appliedFix         "pip install scanpy==1.9.3" ;    # new term
    repr:fixOutcome         "fixed" ;                        # new term
    prov:wasAssociatedWith  repr:codellama_13b ;             # which model
    prov:endedAtTime        "2026-07-15T14:22:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
```

## 7. Scope decisions (v1)

- **Target error types:** `ModuleNotFoundError`, `ImportError` (= `DEPENDENCY_ERROR`).
- **Fix actions (pip-only v1):** `install`, `pin_version`, `none`. `replace_import` = future work.
- **Working dataset:** the Docker pipeline's 214 dependency errors (200 pip-fixable, 14 excluded from repair). No fuller Docker run exists; supplementing with the Grotov buggy-notebook dataset is a fallback if more volume is needed for evaluation.

### 7.1 Explanation scope vs. repair scope (i4 refinement)

The pip-only v1 restriction governs **repair eligibility only**, not explanation eligibility. This is a documented refinement of the L3 design, made explicit while implementing i4 (`RAGRepairAgent`):

- **O1 (`LLMExplainer`) scope:** all 214 `DEPENDENCY_ERROR` rows, matching the Vision Doc's O1 definition ("a component that takes *a dependency-related error message*… and generates a clear, human-readable explanation") — no pip-fixability qualifier appears there.
- **O2/O3 (`RAGRepairAgent`, `FixApplicator`) scope:** only rows where `scope_status == "usable"` (200 of 214). The 14 `scope_status == "excluded"` rows (10 `system_library`, 4 `mapping_unknown`) receive an explanation and an `exclusion_reason`, but no repair attempt.
- Earlier drafts of this note (and of `thesis/architecture.tex`) placed one shared "in scope" gate before *both* LLMExplainer and RAGRepairAgent in the orchestrator sequence. That gate now applies to the RAGRepairAgent branch only; see the mermaid diagram and component-contracts table in §5.
- `scope_status`, `exclusion_reason`, and `split` are computed by `scripts/prepare_dependency_dataset.py` (i1) and are now carried through `scripts/extract_error_contexts.py` (i2)'s enriched JSONL and into `run_llm_explainer.py` (i3)'s logged `input` block, so any later `RAGRepairAgent`/orchestrator implementation can gate on `scope_status` directly instead of re-deriving it.

### 7.2 FixApplicator reality vs. the L3 design (i5 refinement)

Two corrections, made explicit while implementing i5 (`FixApplicator`), to this note's §5/§6.1
framing. Full detail and rationale in `docs/fix-applicator.md`.

- **§5's "fix object + the repo's container" input is only half-available in practice.** The
  persisted i4 fix object (`data/repair-proposals/*.jsonl`) does not by itself carry
  `repository_id`/`notebook_id`/`notebook_name`/`repository_url` - FixApplicator re-joins it against
  the i2 dataset (`data/context-classification/dependency_error_contexts.jsonl`) by
  `notebook_execution_id` to recover them. §6.1's illustrative fix-object JSON (with top-level
  `import_name`/`pypi_evidence`) also does not match `scripts/rag_repair_agent.py`'s actual persisted
  shape (`final_action`/`final_install_name`/`final_version`/nested `input`/`retrieval_result`) -
  i5 was built against the real, implemented shape, not this note's illustration.
- **"The repo's container" does not exist to be reused.** The upstream Docker pipeline's per-repo
  containers/images were never persisted on this machine. FixApplicator rebuilds an equivalent
  environment from the same recipe (same base image, same baseline install loop, same `jupyter
  nbconvert` execution command) on every attempt instead, and - going further than the original
  pipeline itself - checks out each repository's recorded commit when the upstream pipeline's own DB
  has one, since the original pipeline's own clone step does not pin to it.

### 7.3 ResultLogger `run_id` fallback (i6 refinement)

`scripts/result_logger.py` (i6, Part 1) joins one `repair_attempts` row per `RAGRepairAgent` (i4)
record, matched to its `FixApplicator` (i5) outcome by position (the `index` field i5 stamps on
each result is the line number of the i4 file it processed - not `notebook_execution_id`, which
i4 can legitimately repeat across separate attempts at the same notebook). Most i4 records never
reach i5 at all: an excluded row abstains, a failed LLM call produces no fix, and any row not yet
run through `FixApplicator` simply has no outcome yet. The architecture's own component diagram
(§5) still expects these to be logged - `LLMExplainer`'s output reaches `ResultLogger` for every
row, independent of repair eligibility.

**Decision:** when a repair attempt has no matching i5 record, `repair_attempts.run_id` (and
`created_at`) fall back to the i4 record's own `run_id`/`created_at` instead of being left `NULL`.
This keeps every i4 attempt logged and traceable to the run that produced it, at the cost of
`run_id` not always meaning "the FixApplicator run" - for a row with no `outcome`, it means "the
RAGRepairAgent run" instead. i3/i4/i5 are unchanged; none of them accept a shared, externally
supplied `run_id` today; each mints its own per CLI invocation. Threading one orchestration-level
`run_id` through all three stages is left to i7's orchestrator, once it actually calls them in
sequence within one pass.

**Update (i7):** done, with no signature change beyond what was already there.
`rag_repair_agent.run_repair_agent()` and `fix_applicator.apply_and_validate()` already accepted an
optional `run_id` override (each defaulting to its own `i4-`/`i5-<timestamp>` only when omitted);
`scripts/run_pipeline.py` simply passes one shared `i7-<timestamp>` value into every call it makes,
for every round, for the whole invocation. See `docs/pipeline-orchestrator.md` §9 for the full
account, including why this leaves i3/i4/i5's own component-local diagnostic fields untouched.

## 8. Mapping to thesis objectives

| Objective | Realized by | Status after L3 |
|---|---|---|
| O1 — Error explanation | LLMExplainer | designed |
| O2 — Fix generation (PyPI RAG) | RAGRepairAgent + fix object (§6.1) | implemented (i4): `scripts/rag_repair_agent.py`, `scripts/pypi_retriever.py`, `scripts/compatibility_evidence.py` produce a validated, grounded fix object |
| O3 — Fix validation | FixApplicator (re-run in container) | implemented (i5): `scripts/fix_applicator.py`, `scripts/docker_runner.py`, `scripts/notebook_outcome.py` apply a fix and re-run the notebook inside a rebuilt Docker environment; see §7.2 and `docs/fix-applicator.md` for the deviations this required from the design below |
| O4 — Benchmark dataset | `repair_attempts` table (§6.2) | implemented and pilot-validated (i6): `scripts/result_logger.py` joins i2/i3/i4/i5 into the table; full-dataset population is future work (§10 of `docs/result-logger.md`) |
| O5 — Pipeline integration | orchestrator + hook-in (§3, §5) | implemented and small-pilot-validated (i7): `scripts/run_pipeline.py` sequences i2-i6, implements the bounded max-two-round repair loop and the shared orchestration `run_id`; see `docs/pipeline-orchestrator.md`. Full 187-row evaluation and the final one-round-vs-two-round comparison are still future work |
| O6 — KG enrichment | `repair_attempts.rml.ttl` (§6.3) | implemented and pilot-validated (i6): `scripts/export_repair_attempts_csv.py` + `mapping/rml_mapping/repair_attempts.rml.ttl` produce valid RDF linked to the existing FAIR Jupyter KG notebook nodes; full KG population is future work (`docs/result-logger.md`) |

## 9. Open items

- Confirm notebook-ID alignment between the Docker data and the FAIR Jupyter KG's notebook IDs (needed for §6.3 linking — KG notebooks derive from the original conda data).
- Prompt internals (L4) and PyPI RAG internals (L5) are intentionally left out of this note — L3 fixes contracts only.
