# ResultLogger & KG Enrichment (i6)

## 1. Purpose

ResultLogger collects the outputs already produced by the earlier thesis components -
ErrorClassifier (i2), LLMExplainer (i3), RAGRepairAgent (i4), and FixApplicator (i5) - and stores
one row per repair attempt in a SQLite `repair_attempts` table. It does not classify errors,
generate explanations, propose fixes, or apply anything itself; it only joins and persists what
those components already produced, so the result is queryable for evaluation and preserved as
provenance. A second stage (`scripts/export_repair_attempts_csv.py` +
`mapping/rml_mapping/repair_attempts.rml.ttl`) re-expresses those rows as RDF and links them into
the existing FAIR Jupyter Knowledge Graph.

## 2. Inputs

ResultLogger (`scripts/result_logger.py`) reads three or four JSONL files, each already produced by
an earlier component, and joins them with a different strategy per pair - chosen because the real
data does not allow a single uniform join key:

- **i2** (`data/context-classification/dependency_error_contexts.jsonl`, via
  `fix_applicator.load_i2_index()`) - the required base context. Every row in `repair_attempts` must
  resolve a `notebook_execution_id` against this dataset; a miss is a hard `ValueError`, never a
  guess.
- **i3** (`load_i3_index()`) - joined by `notebook_execution_id`. Safe because i2/i3 have exactly one
  row per notebook. `load_i3_index()` raises `AmbiguousExplanationError` if a given i3 file ever
  contains two explanation records for the same `notebook_execution_id`, rather than silently
  picking one.
- **i4** (`load_i4_records()`) - the **driving source**. ResultLogger produces exactly one
  `repair_attempts` row per line of the given i4 file, in file order, including abstained and failed
  attempts (i4 processes every i2 row, not only repair-eligible ones).
- **i5** (`load_i5_index_by_position()`, optional) - joined by **position**, not by
  `notebook_execution_id`. `scripts/fix_applicator.py` stamps each of its output records with the
  0-based line index of the i4 file it processed; ResultLogger uses that same index to find the
  matching i5 outcome for a given i4 line.

The positional i4/i5 join exists specifically because `notebook_execution_id` can legitimately
repeat across i4 lines - the real `data/repair-proposals/i4_live_pilot.jsonl` fixture contains two
separate attempts for `notebook_execution_id=8` (a timed-out run and a later successful re-run), each
with its own `run_id`. Joining by id alone would be ambiguous; joining by line position is not.
`log_repair_attempts()` produces one row per i4 line regardless, so this duplicate case yields two
distinct `repair_attempts` rows rather than being collapsed or cross-matched.

## 3. `repair_attempts` table

The full column list and SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement are defined in `docs/architecture-note.md`
section 6.2; this document does not repeat them. In implementation terms the columns fall into six
groups:

- **error classification** (from i2): `notebook_execution_id`, `failing_module`, `subtype`
- **explanation** (from i3): `explanation`
- **proposed repair** (from i4, or i5 when available): `action`, `install_name`, `version`,
  `command`, `rationale`
- **PyPI evidence** (from i4): `pypi_evidence`
- **repair outcome** (from i5, when available): `outcome`, `new_error_type`, `new_error_message`
- **model/prompt/run metadata**: `llm_model`, `prompt_strategy` (from i3), `round` (currently always
  `1`), `run_id`, `created_at` (see section 5)

`scripts/result_logger.py::create_table()` issues `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, matching the
architecture note's schema exactly; `REPAIR_ATTEMPT_COLUMNS` in that module is the single source of
truth for the column list and is reused by the CSV exporter (section 6).

## 4. JSON preservation

Two columns intentionally hold serialized JSON rather than a reduced/flattened value, so that
downstream evaluation and provenance work never has to go back to the original i3/i4 JSONL files for
detail that was available at logging time:

- **`explanation`** - the complete structured LLM explanation object (`summary`, `root_cause`,
  `evidence`, `failing_module`, `explanation_confidence`, `limitations`, per
  `schemas/explanation.schema.json`) is `json.dumps`-ed into this TEXT column, not reduced to a
  single field.
- **`pypi_evidence`** - the complete i4 `retrieval_result` object (distribution name, all candidate
  versions, compatibility evidence with its source citation, warnings, etc.) is serialized the same
  way, not the smaller three-field illustration shown in `docs/architecture-note.md` section 6.1.

Both are `NULL` when the corresponding upstream record does not exist or carries no value (e.g. an
abstained i4 record has no `retrieval_result`), never an empty string or an empty JSON object.

## 5. Run ID behavior

`repair_attempts.run_id` and `created_at` prefer the i5 record's own `run_id`/`created_at` when a
matching i5 outcome exists for that i4 line (`build_repair_attempt_row()`). When no i5 record exists
- an abstained or failed i4 attempt, or simply one not yet run through FixApplicator - both fields
fall back to the i4 record's own `run_id`/`created_at` instead of being left `NULL`. This keeps every
i4 attempt logged and traceable to the run that produced it, at the cost of `run_id` not always
meaning "the FixApplicator run" for a row with no `outcome`.

i2, i3, i4, and i5 remain unmodified: none of them accept a shared, externally supplied `run_id`
today, and each mints its own per CLI invocation. A shared, orchestration-level `run_id` threaded
through all stages of one pipeline pass is intentionally left for i7's orchestrator. See
`docs/architecture-note.md` section 7.3 for the full rationale.

## 6. SQLite to CSV export

`scripts/export_repair_attempts_csv.py` exports `repair_attempts` rows to a CSV file
(`export_repair_attempts_csv()`). CSV is the target format because every existing FAIR Jupyter KG
mapping (`mapping/rml_mapping/*.rml.ttl`, including `executions.rml.ttl`) reads from a CSV data
source (`rml:referenceFormulation ql:CSV`), not from a live database connection.

`repair_attempts` itself only stores `notebook_execution_id` (see section 3), but the KG identifies a
notebook by `notebook_id`. The exporter resolves `notebook_id` per row by re-joining
`notebook_execution_id` against the same i2 dataset ResultLogger itself requires
(`fix_applicator.load_i2_index()`), the same re-join pattern `FixApplicator` already uses for its own
metadata recovery. A `notebook_execution_id` missing from the given i2 file raises a `ValueError`
naming the offending `repair_attempts.id`, rather than exporting a row with no notebook link.

`CSV_COLUMNS` is `["id", "notebook_id"] + REPAIR_ATTEMPT_COLUMNS` - `notebook_execution_id` is
carried into the CSV for traceability even though the RML mapping does not reference it.

## 7. FAIR Jupyter KG enrichment

`mapping/rml_mapping/repair_attempts.rml.ttl` is modeled directly on the existing
`executions.rml.ttl` (same prefix block, same `rr:TriplesMap`/`rr:PredicateObjectMap` structure) and
defines two triples maps over the exported CSV:

- **The repair attempt itself** - subject `https://w3id.org/reproduceme/repairattempt_{id}`, typed
  both `repr:RepairAttempt` and `prov:Activity`.
- **The link from the notebook** - subject `https://w3id.org/reproduceme/notebook_{notebook_id}`
  (byte-for-byte the same IRI template `notebooks.rml.ttl` already uses, so the two coincide as the
  same node once loaded into the same graph), with one triple:
  `repr:hadRepairAttempt` -> `https://w3id.org/reproduceme/repairattempt_{id}`.

Predicate choices:

- `created_at` -> `prov:endedAtTime`, explicitly typed `xsd:dateTime` (the one place this mapping
  deviates from the untyped-literal style of the rest of the KG, since PROV-O's own spec gives
  `prov:endedAtTime` an `xsd:dateTime` range).
- `new_error_type` -> `repr:exception` and `new_error_message` -> `repr:msg`, reusing the same
  predicates `executions.rml.ttl` uses for a `CellExecution`'s own exception/message, rather than
  minting new ones for what is the same kind of fact observed after the fix.
- `llm_model` -> `repr:llmModel`, a plain literal - not a PROV-O Agent resource.
- New `repr:` predicates for every other repair-specific fact: `repr:failingModule`, `repr:subtype`,
  `repr:explanation`, `repr:fixAction`, `repr:installName`, `repr:fixVersion`, `repr:fixCommand`,
  `repr:fixRationale`, `repr:pypiEvidence`, `repr:fixOutcome`, `repr:promptStrategy`, `repr:round`,
  `repr:runId`.

## 8. Notebook ID alignment

`docs/architecture-note.md` section 9 left this as an open item: the FAIR Jupyter KG is generated
from the original conda-pipeline dataset, not the Docker pipeline this thesis builds on, so it was
not known whether the two share notebook identifiers. This is checked directly, not assumed, and is
now **reproducible from this repository** via `scripts/validate_kg_notebook_alignment.py`: for every
row of `data/context-classification/dependency_error_contexts.jsonl` it looks up `repository_id` and
`notebook_id` in the external FAIR Jupyter KG's own `repositories.csv`/`notebooks.csv` and compares
the resolved repository path and notebook filename (and the notebook's own `repository_id` column,
so a coincidental id collision across repositories cannot pass as a match) for an exact string match.

The external FAIR Jupyter KG checkout is a separate upstream project (not part of this repository)
and is not committed here - its `notebooks.csv` alone is 27,303 rows. The script instead takes the
checkout's two source files as CLI arguments:

```
python scripts/validate_kg_notebook_alignment.py \
  --i2 data/context-classification/dependency_error_contexts.jsonl \
  --repositories-csv /path/to/fairjupyter-checkout/data/repositories.csv \
  --notebooks-csv /path/to/fairjupyter-checkout/data/notebooks.csv
```

Example, run from WSL against a checkout under the Windows filesystem:

```
python scripts/validate_kg_notebook_alignment.py \
  --repositories-csv /mnt/c/Users/zaimi/Documents/Thesis/fair-jupyter-kg/fairjupyter-main/data/repositories.csv \
  --notebooks-csv /mnt/c/Users/zaimi/Documents/Thesis/fair-jupyter-kg/fairjupyter-main/data/notebooks.csv
```

Result, against the real 214-row dataset and a real local FAIR Jupyter KG checkout:

```
Records checked: 214
Repository matches: 214/214
Notebook matches: 214/214
Missing: 0
Mismatches: 0
```

The script exits `0` only when `Missing` and `Mismatches` are both zero; any missing or mismatched
record is printed individually (with the reason) before the summary and the script exits `1`, so
this is a genuine pass/fail check rather than a report to eyeball.
`tests/test_validate_kg_notebook_alignment.py` covers the match/mismatch/missing/duplicate-source-id
logic against small in-memory CSV fixtures and does not depend on the external checkout.

This confirms no crosswalk table is required **for the FAIR Jupyter KG snapshot actually inspected
here** - the Docker pipeline's `repository_id`/`notebook_id` values line up exactly with this
checkout's `repositories`/`notebooks` primary keys. It does not imply every possible FAIR Jupyter KG
snapshot, export, or future re-run of the upstream pipeline will necessarily assign the same ids; a
different snapshot should be re-checked with this same script before relying on the same conclusion.

## 9. Validation

- Full Python test suite: **346 passed** (`pytest tests/`), including the pre-existing i1-i5 suites
  and `tests/test_validate_kg_notebook_alignment.py` (section 8).
- `tests/test_result_logger.py` - loader behavior, the duplicate-`notebook_execution_id` regression
  case described in section 2, the i5-missing run_id fallback, and end-to-end
  `log_repair_attempts()` runs against temporary JSONL fixtures.
- `tests/test_export_repair_attempts_csv.py` - `notebook_id` resolution, CSV header/column order,
  `NULL` columns becoming empty CSV fields (not the string `"None"`), JSON blob round-tripping
  through the CSV writer/reader unchanged, and the missing-i2-context error.
- `tests/test_validate_kg_notebook_alignment.py` - the section 8 alignment check's match/mismatch/
  missing/duplicate-source-id logic, against small in-memory fixtures only.
- `morph_kgc` (the same RML engine `run_fairjupyter_kg.sh` uses) was installed and run against a real
  `repair_attempts.csv` built from the real i2/i3/i4 pilot data plus a labeled synthetic i5 fixture
  (no live i5 output exists yet - see `docs/architecture-note.md` section 7.2 on why). The generated
  RDF was inspected directly: `NULL` SQLite columns produce no triple at all for the corresponding
  predicate (not an empty-string literal), `repr:exception`/`repr:msg` appear only on the one row
  that actually has a post-repair error, and `prov:endedAtTime` is present and correctly typed
  `xsd:dateTime` for every row.
- Notebook links were re-verified against the **real, unmodified** `notebooks.rml.ttl`, run against a
  small real subset of the real `notebooks.csv`/`repositories.csv` (exactly the three notebooks
  appearing in the pilot `repair_attempts.csv`: notebook_id 27, 35, 428). `run_fairjupyter_kg.sh`
  itself materializes every `.rml.ttl` mapping as its own separate `morph_kgc` process and writes
  each to its own `.nt` file (see the script) - so `notebooks.rml.ttl` and `repair_attempts.rml.ttl`
  were likewise materialized as two independent `morph_kgc` calls and their output graphs unioned,
  rather than fed into one shared mapping config (the two files reuse the same internal `map:`-scoped
  local names for their triples-maps/logical-sources, e.g. `map:source_000`, which collide if loaded
  together into a single config - harmless for the real per-file pipeline, but it means this
  validation must mirror that per-file invocation rather than batch the mappings together). The
  union confirmed all four generated `repr:hadRepairAttempt` links (`notebook_27` x2, `notebook_35`,
  `notebook_428`) point to subjects the unmodified `notebooks.rml.ttl` independently produced as
  `rdf:type repr:Notebook` - not merely matching by string inspection.
- The FAIR Jupyter KG checkout was not modified: all mapping files and CSVs used above were read
  directly or copied into a scratch location before materialization; nothing was written back into
  the checkout.

## 10. Scope boundary / i7

i6 does not implement:

- Orchestration of ErrorClassifier, LLMExplainer, RAGRepairAgent, and FixApplicator into a single
  pipeline pass.
- Automatic execution over the full dataset - ResultLogger and the CSV/RDF export are invoked against
  whatever i2/i3/i4/i5 JSONL files already exist, not run as part of a batch driver.
- The second repair attempt / bounded two-round repair loop (`round` is currently always `1`; no
  feedback from a `still_failing` outcome back into RAGRepairAgent exists).

These, along with the shared orchestration-level `run_id` noted in section 5, belong to i7.

## 11. Full-scale materialisation of the final evaluation run (2026-09-20)

Sections 9-10 describe the i6-era pilot. The same exporter and mapping, both unchanged, were later
run over the complete `repair_attempts` table of the final Gemma evaluation run
(`data/evaluation/i10-eval-gemma-round2-explanations-20260918T161356Z/raw/repair_attempts.sqlite`,
235 rows: 187 Round 1 + 48 Round 2, of which 73 carry an executed fix application). Morph-KGC
2.10.0 produced 3,478 triples: 235 `repr:RepairAttempt`/`prov:Activity` resources and 235
`repr:hadRepairAttempt` links to 187 distinct notebook IRIs, all of which the unmodified upstream
`notebooks.rml.ttl` independently produces as `rdf:type repr:Notebook` (627,127 triples). 24
explicit checks against the SQLite table as ground truth all passed. The export, the triples
(`.nt` and a prefixed `.ttl` re-serialisation), the Morph-KGC config and log, the check script, and
the JSON report live in that run's `kg/` directory - see its `README.md`. Nothing was written into
the external FAIR Jupyter checkout.
