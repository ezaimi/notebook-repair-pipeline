"""Docker/git execution wrapper for FixApplicator (i5).

Every external process is invoked as an argv list through an injectable
`runner` callable (default: subprocess.run with shell disabled) - this
module never builds a shell string, never shells out via the OS command
interpreter, and never evaluates dynamic code. Tests inject a fake runner
so the automated suite never needs Docker, git, or network access.

Reference design (read-only inspection, never modified, never imported at
runtime): the sibling FAIR Jupyter Docker pipeline at
`~/era/computational-reproducibility-pmc-docker` (lib/docker.sh,
lib/entrypoint.sh, lib/repo.sh). Its per-repo containers/images were never
persisted on this machine (confirmed empty `docker images`/`docker ps -a`
for any FAIR-Jupyter-named artifact), so this module rebuilds an
equivalent environment from the same recipe on every attempt rather than
attaching to a container that no longer exists. Two deliberate deviations
from that reference, both documented in docs/fix-applicator.md:

1. The build context here is a small, isolated directory containing only
   the generated Dockerfile/entrypoint.sh - never the cloned repository
   itself (avoids sending a whole git history as Docker build context).
   The repo is instead bind-mounted at /app at *run* time, exactly as the
   reference pipeline also does.
2. `docker run` here does not pass `--user <host-uid>:<host-gid>` the way
   the reference pipeline does. That flag exists there so pip's own
   `--user` installs (still reused verbatim in the requirements loop
   below) land in a location the host-mapped, non-root user can write.
   Dropping it means the container runs as its default (root) user, which
   is what allows RAGRepairAgent's (i4) own unmodified argv - e.g.
   ["python", "-m", "pip", "install", "scikit-learn"], with no --user flag
   of its own - to install successfully without this module rewriting a
   value that already passed i4's grounding validation. The container is
   single-use and disposed of after every attempt, so running it as root
   carries no meaningful additional risk.
